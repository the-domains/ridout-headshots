**Representing Your Business the Right Way!**

Whether you want to post your headshot on your company's website, or want to post it on your social media pages, you are always representing your business in one way or another. You might deal with other businesses or with the general public, but a professional headshot will put confidence into your business and make your clients (both businesses and public) more willing to deal with you.

Think about it for a moment, if you were searching for a new supplier and found that a certain company was a very viable supplier, but the CEO had an unprofessional headshot in casual clothes -- would you be willing to deal with this company?
